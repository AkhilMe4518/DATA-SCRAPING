# DATA-SCRAPING
(NOTE:This code works when the html page renders properly while we scrap data)
More often it works great with single url and needs html sessions to scrap more urls


In this project we will be scraping data from AMAZON WEBSITE
urls will be of form : "https://www.amazon.{country}/dp/{asin}"
The country and the asin is given in the csv file 


Step1:
	Extract urls and store it in a list using pandas
	
	
Step2:
	Access the list of urls and get Product inforamtion using Bs4
